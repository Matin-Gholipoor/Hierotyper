# Hierotyper ⌨️

Hierotyper is a **minimal, accessible, and highly customizable typing practice app** designed and built entirely from scratch based on real user needs.

This project started as a personal solution to improve typing skills—and evolved into a complete UI/UX-driven web application that removes many of the constraints found in existing typing platforms.

## 🧠 The Story Behind Hierotyper

Last summer, I decided to seriously learn touch typing.  
Naturally, I explored many Persian and English typing practice websites and tried practicing with all of them.

Each platform worked—to some extent—but all of them had limitations.

So, with the help of AI, I built a **very simple typing app**.  
It was… functional 😄  
And also **full of bugs**.

Despite the bugs, that rough version helped me improve my typing skills—but using it was painful.

Later, after attending **UI/UX design courses**, I realized this was the perfect opportunity to redesign the idea **properly**, this time starting from real user needs—my own.

The biggest challenge I had with existing typing websites was this:
- Many platforms used **repetitive texts**, so after a while I wasn’t practicing typing anymore—I was typing from memory.
- Other platforms had **better text variety**, but were too advanced and lacked beginner-friendly settings and controls.

So I decided to design **my own typing app**, from scratch, and include everything I personally needed:
full control, flexibility, accessibility, and simplicity.

Hierotyper is the result of that process—a typing app designed **for the user (me)**, but hopefully useful and enjoyable for others as well.

This project is actively open to feedback.  
Improvements and refinements will be applied based on comments, suggestions, and insights from others.

I hope you enjoy using it, and that it helps you improve your typing too ❤️
